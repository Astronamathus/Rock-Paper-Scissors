# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Just a normal game of Rock Paper Scissors written in Java.
The gameplay consists of three rounds in which you play against a computer. 
Win a round, win one point.
Win more points than the computer, you win.
If you win less points than the computer, you're a disgrace to humanity. Just kidding. Or not.
